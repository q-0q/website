## About

This site is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). UI animations are done with the [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) framework.

The articles are written by me in Markdown and dynamically converted to HTML using [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark). Videos are stored in Vercel Blob storage and embedded using [remark-directive-sugar](https://github.com/lin-stephanie/remark-directive-sugar). Codeblock syntax highlighting is done with [rehype-rehighlight](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-highlight).
