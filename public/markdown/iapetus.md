## About

*Iapetus* is a 3D platformer inspired by games like *Mirror's Edge*, *Super Mario Odyssey*, and *Celeste*. These games implement emergent movement systems where the player is given a sandbox of mobility tools that they are free to mix and match to carve their own personal paths through the game.

Here is a demonstration of Iapetus's core movement. The player can run, jump, vault over ledges, wall-cling, and wall-jump. Momentum is a core mechanic that builds the player's speed when they move continuously forward or perform certain actions. Most basic movements like jumping, vaulting, and wall-jumping have dynamic behavior based on Momentum. You jump further, vault faster, and wall-jump higher with greater Momentum.

Supplementing these basic options is the flipdash, which acts as a horizontal, forward-pointing double-jump. Jumping immediately after landing from a flipdash lets you do a special follow-up long jump. The flipdash can also be tech'd by entering the flipdash state immediately before landing on the ground or vaulting over a ledge, which provides even greater agility...

## Technical insights

### Player controller

The player controller is built with [Wasp](/code?item=Wasp) machines at its core but borrows a lot of the meta-patterns I first designed for *[Project Silver Needle](/games?item=Project%20Silver%20Needle)* that add support for inheritable state machines. *PSN*, however, is built on top of Photon Quantum's ECS, which blocked my player controllers from being able to interface with Unity's native `MonoBehaviour`. *Iapetus* is free from this restriction, meaning each Wasp machine can be its own `GameObject`.

To keep controller code as reusable as possible, machine types follow class-based inheritance, where all machines inherit from the abstract base class `Fsm`. More specific machine types can then add extra configurations on top of this class. For example, the abstract `GravityFsm` class inherits from `Fsm` and adds states and behaviors for ground-checking, falling, and other pseudo-physics tasks like depenetration.

This allows any other machine that wishes to react to gravity, such as the player, enemies, or static rigidbody-like game objects, to inherit from `GravityFsm` to have access to all of that state behavior. The subclasses are free to build on top of the configurations provided by the base classes. For example, an enemy could implement a `GroundSlam` state that is entered when the `StartFrameGrounded` trigger is fired from its parent `GravityFsm` class without needing to worry about checking that itself.

### Dynamic animation

In an attempt to make the player's motion feel dynamic without creating dozens of animations for each action, I implemented a simple use case of Animator Blend Trees where I have 2â€“3 versions of each animation that have been animated at different speed postures but with the same actual frame count and duration. At runtime, based on the player's Momentum value, I can update the weight of the Blend Tree to interpolate between the different postures. For animations like running, I set the animation play speed as a function of Momentum as well.

Currently, I have disabled all keyframe interpolation for the animations. This suggests a more "comic-book" style of motion which I am still adjusting. One improvement I would like to make is how the fluid dynamic weight adjustments caused by player Momentum clash with the look created by non-interpolated keyframes. I think snapping the weight to some nearest increment could help with this, or better yet, only update the animator's weight when a new animation keyframe occurs.

### Cutout shader

I use a shader to create a cutout effect when the player is obscured from the 3rd-person camera.

The objects in the environment are using a ShaderGraph shader that implements a series of rules determining if a particular pixel should be made transparent. The pixel's distance from the player in screen space and its physical distance from the camera are the main things that are checked. A collision-detection raycast from the camera to the player controls when the system is active.
